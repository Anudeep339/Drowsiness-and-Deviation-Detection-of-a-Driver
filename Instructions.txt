            iv)Wait until both devices get paired.
    3) Now connect the master HC-05 to the server(laptop / raspberry pi)
    4) Open Device manager and Note the COM port assigned to the HC05 bluetooth module.
    5) Open Serial_Highway_project_CoOrdinates.py python file and change the noted COM port in the instructed field.
    6) Change the names of the ID_1 , ID_2 in the required fields. (optional, Even without changing program works)
    7) Now for running the python file,
            i)Press win+R
            ii)Type cmd and press Enter
            iii)Now type   cd <Location of the project folder in your PC> (In my case I have typed, cd C:\Users\*****\Documents\My_projects\highway_project ) and Press Enter.
